# Ignis Tech Solution

## Caveats
> It should be a single main.py file and output json file all pushed on a private github repo. Add ignis-tech-solutions as a collaborator to your repository.

No idea what output.json should be generated

> The above url contains around 3740 shoes, we need to scrape data for all those shoes.

The number is 3729 instead from the api.
